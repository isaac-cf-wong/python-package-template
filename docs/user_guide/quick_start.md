# Quick Start

Welcome to the **Python Package Template**! This template provides a standardized,
production-ready setup for building Python packages.
It includes modern tooling, best practices, and configurations to help you get started quickly.

## What This Template Provides

This template includes:

- **Modern Python Packaging**: Uses `pyproject.toml` with Hatchling and Hatch-VCS for version management
- **Development Tools**: Pre-configured with Black, Ruff, Pylint, Pre-commit hooks, and more
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest with coverage reporting and fixtures
- **Documentation**: MkDocs with Material theme for API docs and user guides
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for validation, testing, and publishing
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, spell checking, and security scanning
- **Example Code**: A sample `hello_world` module with CLI

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/isaac-cf-wong/python-package-template)
2. Click **"Use this template"** to create your own repository
3. Clone your new repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python environment management:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.10

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in development mode with all dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev,docs,test]"
```

Alternatively, use pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev,docs,test]"
```

### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks and Commit Message Validation

The template uses pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality before commits,
and commitlint to validate commit messages follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
This ensures consistent, well-documented changes.

**Install commitlint dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

This installs `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-angular`,
which validate that your commit messages follow the conventional commits format
(e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).

**Install pre-commit hooks:**

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

This sets up automatic checks that run before each commit, including:

- Code formatting (Black)
- Linting (Ruff, Pylint)
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Spell checking (CSpell)
- Commit message validation (commitlint)

Hooks will automatically fix many issues or prevent commits that violate rules, helping maintain code quality.

This will run formatting, linting, and other checks automatically on each commit.

### 4. Run Tests

Verify everything works:

```bash
pytest
```

You should see all tests pass with coverage reporting.

### 5. Build Documentation

Generate and view the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to see the docs.

## Development Workflow

### Code Structure

Your package code goes in `src/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/`:

- `src/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/__init__.py`: Package initialization and exports
- `src/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/__main__.py`: Entry point for `python -m YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME`
- Add your modules in subdirectories as needed

### Writing Code

1. **Follow the Style**: Code is automatically formatted with Black (120 char line length)
2. **Add Type Hints**: Use modern Python typing
3. **Write Tests**: Add tests in `tests/` directory
4. **Update Docs**: Add docstrings for API documentation

### Example: Running the Sample Code

Try the included example:

```bash
# Run as a module
python -m python_package_template

# Or use the CLI (if configured)
python_package_template --help
```

### Building and Publishing

When ready to release:

1. Run tests and checks locally: `pytest && pre-commit run --all-files`
2. Create a git tag for the new version: `git tag v1.0.0` (replace with your version)
3. Push the tag to the remote repository: `git push origin v1.0.0`
4. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically create a release and publish to PyPI

## Key Configurations

- **pyproject.toml**: Package metadata, dependencies, tool configs
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **cliff.toml**: Configuration for automatic changelog generation using git-cliff
- **mkdocs.yml**: Documentation configuration
- **.github/workflows/**: CI/CD pipelines

## Next Steps

- Customize package name and metadata in `pyproject.toml`
- Replace example code with your functionality
- Update documentation in `docs/`
- Configure CI secrets for PyPI publishing
- Add your own dependencies and tools
